    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100
    let age2 = age
    console.log(age, age2)
    age =200
    console.log(age, age2)

    let name = 'Wes'
    let name2 = name
    console.log(name, name2)
    name = 'Wesley'
    console.log(name, name2)

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players

    console.log(players, team)
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players, team)
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
        // unlike strings, numbers and booleans in the above example
        // the original array gets updated too.
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice()  // pass slice nothing and it'll make a copy
    team2[3] = 'Pete'
    console.log(players, team2)    
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)
    team3[3] = 'sweet'
    console.log(players, team3)    

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    team4[3] = 'heeee hawww'
    console.log(players, team4)

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    team5[3] = 'cool'
    console.log(players, team5)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80
    }
    console.log(person)

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person
    captain.number = 99
    console.log(person, captain)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign( {}, person, { street: 3, age: 12 })
    console.log(person, cap2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person}
    console.log(cap3)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
        name: 'Wes',
        age: 100,
        social: {
            twitter: '@wesbos',
            facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
        }
    }

    console.log(wes)

    const dev = Object.assign( {}, wes)
    console.log(wes, dev)

    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman'
    console.log(wes, dev)

    // Object.assign only does one level deep
    // can use a cloneDeep function but first ask if it is necessary

    // not recommended but you can do the poor mans deep clone...
    // turns the object into a string, copies it, then immediately turns it back into an object
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes))

    dev2.social.twitter = '@whatsup'
    console.log(wes, dev2)
